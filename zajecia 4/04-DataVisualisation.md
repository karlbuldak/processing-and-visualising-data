# DATA VISUALISATION

Data visualization is the art of representing information and data graphically. It transforms complex data into accessible visual forms, making it easier for people to understand trends, patterns, and relationships. A chart, also known as a graph, is a visual representation of data. It allows users to see and understand information more effectively. Charts serve as powerful tools in various contexts, including business, communication, and data visualization. They transform complex data into accessible visual representations, aiding understanding, decision-making, and effective communication.



## Creating Charts from Data Series

1. To use Pandas for creating charts, first you need to download and install the matplotlib library:

    ```
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

1. Open the notebook series-chart.ipynb. Learn how to create a simple chart in the pandas library. Then, complete all tasks in the notebook.

1. The list below contains the tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam tournaments. Create a new notebook and then a chart presenting the data from the table. Remember to include the title and description of the chart axis.

    Player         | Titles
    ---------------|-------
    Novak Djokovic | 24
    Rafael Nadal   | 22
    Roger Federer  | 20
    Pete Sampras   | 14



## Creating Charts from DataFrame

1. Open the notebook dataframe-chart.ipynb. Learn how to create charts based on a data frame. Then, complete all tasks in the notebook.

1. Create a new notebook. Then, based on the employees.csv file, create a bar chart presenting the average age of women and men (two bars).

1. A histogram is a chart that plots the distribution of a numeric variable’s values as a series of bars. Each bar typically covers a range of numeric values called a bin or class; a bar’s height indicates the frequency of data points with a value within the corresponding bin.

    In the previous notebook, create two histograms showing a salary distribution both for men and women. The data can be found in the employees.csv file. Place both charts in one drawing. Use a subplot.

1. Create a new notebook. Then, based on the european-countries.csv file, create:

    * a bar chart with the population of Central European countries (sort the data by population)
    * a pie chart presenting the percentage of the regions' area.
